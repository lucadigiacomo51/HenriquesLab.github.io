### News about the laboratory
We'll be opening a new laboratory at <b>[Instituto Gulbenkian de CiÃªncia](https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/)</b> this summer.

### Who are we

<img src='./images/logo_lab.jpg' style='width: 75%'>

We like to think of ourselves as <b>optical biologists</b>. We focus on addressing <b>biomedical questions</b> by exploiting advancements we develop in <b>optical microscopy</b>. To do so, we create <b>open-technology</b> that pushes the boundaries of <b>cellular imaging</b>. All our research and methods are transparent, reproducible and widely available to researchers. In biology, we tackle broad <b>virology, host-pathogen interactions, immunology and cell signalling</b> questions. We do so by establishing <b>new classes of fluorescent probes, high-speed cell-friendly super-resolution methods and computational modelling approaches</b> that, although designed to answer questions of interest in the lab, have extensive cross-disciplinary applications.

### The Laboratory

We're dominantly based at the [MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lmcb/) in [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) with a small additional laboratory at [The Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/). Check out our [research page](research) to know more about what we do.
